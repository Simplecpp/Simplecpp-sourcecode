This idea, scanning an array from the beginning to the end in order to
determine if a certain element is stored in the array, is sometimes
called {\em linear search}.

The code above is unsatisfactory in two ways.  First, if the given
value {\tt r} is not present in the array, it would be polite to print
a message to that effect.  Second, once we find {\tt r} at some index,
there is no need to scan the remaining elements.  Both these goals can
be acheived by replacing the {\tt for} loop above with the following.
\begin{verbatim}
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i<60; i++){
       if(rollno[i] == r){ cout << marks[i] << endl; break;}
    }
    if(i >= 60) cout << "Invalid roll number.\n";
}
